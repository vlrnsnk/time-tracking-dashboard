## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Preview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (modular architecture: abstracts, base, components, layout)
- CSS custom properties (design tokens via SCSS variables)
- Flexbox / Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- Sharp image processing
- Stylelint (code quality + property ordering)
- HTML validation
- Husky (pre-commit hooks)

## Setup

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Image optimization

Generate modern image formats:

```bash
npm run images
```

This creates .webp and .avif versions of images inside:

```bash
src/assets/images/
```

Example:

```bash
image-hero.png
image-hero.webp
image-hero.avif
```

Use <picture> with AVIF → WebP → original fallback:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.png" alt="" />
</picture>
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint:scss
npm run lint:html
```

This project uses Stylelint + EditorConfig + Husky pre-commit hooks
to ensure consistent code formatting before commits.

### Fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:scss:fix
npm run lint:html:fix
```

## Deployment

Project is built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Performance

Lighthouse score (example):

- Performance: {{PERF_SCORE}}
- Accessibility: {{ACCESSIBILITY_SCORE}}
- Best Practices: {{BEST_PRACTICES_SCORE}}
- SEO: {{SEO_SCORE}}

## Continued Development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

## Useful Resources
